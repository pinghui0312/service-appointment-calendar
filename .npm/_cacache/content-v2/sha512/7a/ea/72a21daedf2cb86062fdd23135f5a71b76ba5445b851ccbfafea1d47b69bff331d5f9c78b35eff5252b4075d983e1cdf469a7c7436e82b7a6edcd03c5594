You can use the AWS CDK Toolkit Library to implement actions such as bootstrapping, synthesizing, and deploying through code rather than command-line interface (CLI) commands. With this library, you can create custom tools, build specialized CLI applications, and integrate CDK programmatic access capabilities into your development workflows.\n\n## Get started with the AWS CDK Toolkit Library\n\n### Step 1: Install the CDK Toolkit Library\n\nAdd the `@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib` package to your code base:\n\n```console\nnpm install --save @aws-cdk/toolkit-lib\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create and configure a new instance of the CDK Toolkit\n\nYou will use the CDK Toolkit instance to define the actions to perform on your CDK app.\nThe following is an example of creating a new instance of the CDK Toolkit:\n\n```ts\nimport { Toolkit } from '@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib';\n\nconst cdk = new Toolkit({\n   // Optional configuration options go here\n});\n```\n\nYou can optionally customize the CDK Toolkit instance during creation.\nFor instructions, see [Configure your CDK Toolkit instance](#configure-your-cdk-toolkit-instance).\n\n### Step 3: Create a cloud assembly source for your CDK app\n\nA _Cloud Assembly_ represents the AWS CloudFormation templates and deployment artifacts that are produced from a CDK app.\nWith the CDK, the Cloud Assembly is generated during synthesis and is what gets deployed to provision your infrastructure.\nThe CDK Toolkit creates a _Cloud Assembly_ from a _Cloud Assembly Source_.\n\nThe _Cloud Assembly Source_ is a fundamental CDK Toolkit component that defines instructions for creating a _Cloud Assembly_ from your app.\nFor example, CDK apps may need to be synthesized multiple times with additional context values before they are ready.\nOnce created, you can use your _Cloud Assembly Source_ to perform actions  with the CDK Toolkit.\n\nThe following is an example of creating a _Cloud Assembly Source_ using the _assembly builder function_:\n\n```ts\nimport * as core from 'aws-cdk-lib/core';\n\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\n\nconst cx = await cdk.fromAssemblyBuilder(async () => {\n  const app = new core.App();\n\n  // Define your stacks here\n  new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');\n\n  return app.synth();\n});\n```\n\nFor more details, see [Cloud Assembly Sources](#cloud-assembly-sources).\n\n### Step 4: Define programmatic actions in for your CDK app\n\nNow that you’ve created a CDK Toolkit instance and Cloud Assembly Source, you can start to define programmatic actions.\nThe following is a basic example that creates a deployment of the `MyStack` stack:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nawait cdk.deploy(cx, {\n  stacks: {\n    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n    patterns: [\"MyStack\"],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Step 5: Customize the CDK Toolkit further\n\nYou can configure and customize the CDK Toolkit further for your needs:\n\n* **Messages and requests** - The CDK Toolkit outputs a structured flow of messages and requests back to the client, such as a human actor or application using the CDK Toolkit. For instructions, see [Messages & interaction](#messages--interaction).\n* **Error handling** - The CDK Toolkit uses structured errors to help you identify and handle issues during Toolkit operations. You can integrate error handling into your app or customize them further for your needs. For instructions, see [Error handling](#error-handling).\n\n## Actions\n\nThe CDK Toolkit Library provides programmatic interfaces for the following lifecycle actions.\nSupport for further actions will be extended over time.\n\n### synth\n\nSynthesis is the process of producing AWS CloudFormation templates and deployment artifacts from a CDK app.\nFor an introduction to synthesis, see [Configure and perform CDK stack synthesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/configure-synth.html).\nIn the CDK Toolkit Library, you can use synth to produce a reusable snapshot of a _Cloud Assembly Source_.\nThis is useful if the same source will be used with multiple Toolkit actions,\nbecause the _Cloud Assembly_ does not have to be produced multiple times.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const source: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\n// Will run the CDK app defined in the Cloud Assembly Source\n// This is an expensive and slow operation\n// But its result can be stored and re-used\nconst cx = await cdk.synth(source, {\n  validateStacks: true, // set to `false` to not throw an error if stacks in the assembly contain error annotations\n})\n\n// Will use the previously synthesized Cloud Assembly\n// This is now a cheap and fast operation\nconst appDetails = await cdk.list(cx);\n```\n\nYou can also query information about the synthesized _Cloud Assembly_:\n\n```ts\nconst cloudAssembly = await cx.produce();\nconst template = cloudAssembly.getStackByName(\"my-stack\").template;\n```\n\n### list\n\nThe list operation provides high-level information about the stacks and their dependencies within a CDK application.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nconst details = await cdk.list(cx, {\n  // optionally provide a stack selector to control which stacks are returned\n  stacks: {\n    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n    patterns: [\"my-stack\"],\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### diff\n\nYou can create a diff of your app to gain detailed insights into what will be changing in the next deployment.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nconst stackDiffs = await cdk.diff(cx, {\n  // optionally provide a stack selector to control which stacks you want to create a diff for\n  stacks: {\n    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n    patterns: [\"my-stack\"],\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### deploy\n\nDeployment is the process of provisioning or updating your infrastructure in AWS using the CloudFormation templates and assets produced during synthesis.\nFor an introduction to deploying, see [Deploy AWS CDK applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/deploy.html).\nWith the CDK Toolkit Library, you can programmatically control deployments, including stack selection, rollback behavior, and deployment monitoring.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nawait cdk.deploy(cx, {\n  deploymentMethod: { method: \"direct \" }, // use direct deployments instead of change-sets\n  parameters: StackParameters.exactly({ /* ... */ }), // provide new values for stack parameters\n})\n```\n\n### rollback\n\nRollback returns a stack to its last stable state when a deployment fails or needs to be reversed.\nThe CDK Toolkit Library allows you to programmatically roll back failed deployments.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nawait cdk.rollback(cx, {\n  orphanFailedResources: false, // set to `true` to automatically orphan all failed resources\n})\n```\n\n### watch\n\nUse the watch feature to continuously monitor your CDK app for local changes and automatically perform deployments or hotswaps.\nThis will create a file watcher that is terminated once your code exits.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nawait cdk.watch(cx, {\n  include: [], // optionally provide a list of file path patterns to watch\n  exclude: [], // or exclude files by file path patterns\n})\n```\n\n### drift\n\nDrift detection is crucial for maintaining infrastructure reliability.\nIt identifies when your deployed resources have been modified outside of your CDK code.\nThis allows you to quickly address unauthorized changes.\nSuch changes could lead to security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, or unexpected behavior in your cloud environment.\n\nUse the drift operation to detect such drift in your CDK applications:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nconst stackDrifts = await cdk.drift(cx, {\n  // optionally provide a stack selector to control which stacks are checked for drift\n  stacks: {\n    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n    patterns: [\"my-stack\"],\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### destroy\n\nUse the destroy feature to remove CDK stacks and their associated resources from AWS:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\nawait cdk.destroy(cx, {\n  // optionally provide a stack selector to control which stacks are destroyed\n  stacks: {\n    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n    patterns: [\"my-stack\"],\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Configure your CDK Toolkit instance\n\n### Messages & interaction\n\nThe CDK Toolkit outputs a structured flow of _messages_ and _requests_ back to a client integrating with the Toolkit.\n\n* **Messages** - Informs the client about the progress and state of operations. Does not require a response.\n* **Requests** - Special messages that allow the client to respond. If no response is given, the Toolkit will use a default response.\n\nThe CDK Toolkit Library outputs messages and requests through an `IoHost`.\nThink of the `IoHost` as the blueprint that defines how communication works for the CDK Toolkit.\nFor each message or request, the Toolkit calls either the `notify` or `requestResponse` method of the `IoHost`.\n\n#### Customizing the IoHost\n\nYou can configure a custom `IoHost` to control the flow of information and integrate them into your workflows and automation.\nThe following is an example implementation that simply logs all message objects to stdout:\n\n```ts\nconst toolkit = new toolkitLib.Toolkit({\n  ioHost: {\n    notify: async function (msg) {\n      console.log(msg);\n    },\n    requestResponse: async function (msg) {\n      console.log(msg);\n      return msg.defaultResponse;\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe CDK Toolkit awaits the completion of each call, allowing clients to perform asynchronous operations like HTTP requests when handling messages or requests.\nWhen you implement an `IoHost` interface, you can either process these communications (for example, logging to CloudWatch or prompting users for input) or return immediately without taking action.\nIf your implementation doesn’t provide a response to a request, the CDK Toolkit proceeds with a default value.\n\n#### Default `NonInteractiveIoHost`\n\nBy default the CDK Toolkit Library will use a `NonInteractiveIoHost ` implementation that mimics the behavior of the AWS CDK Toolkit CLI.\nThis `NonInteractiveIoHost` is available for you as a base implementation to extend on.\n\n### Configure your AWS profile\n\nThe Toolkit internally uses AWS SDK Clients to make necessary API calls to AWS.\nAuthentication configuration is loaded automatically from the environment, but you can explicitly specify the base credentials to be used:\n\n```ts\nimport { Toolkit, BaseCredentials } from '@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib';\n\nconst cdk = new Toolkit({\n  sdkConfig: { \n    baseCredentials: BaseCredentials.awsCliCompatible({ profile: \"my-profile\" })\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Configure a proxy for SDK calls\n\nThe Toolkit internally uses AWS SDK Clients to make necessary API calls to AWS.\nYou can specify a Node.js Agent to configure SDK calls.\nThis allows you to configure third-party packages like [`proxy-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent) to proxy all SDK calls:\n\n```ts\nimport { ProxyAgent } from 'proxy-agent';\nimport { Toolkit } from '@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib';\n\nconst cdk = new Toolkit({\n  sdkConfig: {\n    httpOptions: {\n      agent: new ProxyAgent(),\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Configure Toolkit Actions\n\nEvery action the CDK Toolkit Library provides has its own options.\nHowever some arguments and options are shared between multiple actions.\n\n## Cloud Assembly Sources\n\nThe _Cloud Assembly Source_ is a fundamental CDK Toolkit component that defines instructions for creating a _Cloud Assembly_ from your app.\nFor example, CDK apps may need to be synthesized multiple times with additional context values before they are ready.\nOnce created, you can use your _Cloud Assembly Source_ to perform actions  with the CDK Toolkit.\n\nEvery _Cloud Assembly Source_ must implement the `ICloudAssemblySource` interface. This allows you to define your own custom sources.\n\n```ts\ninterface ICloudAssemblySource {\n  produce(): Promise<cxapi.CloudAssembly>;\n}\n```\n\nFor convenience the CDK Toolkit Library offers a range of standard sources, which can be instantiated using the `fromXyz()` helper methods on your toolkit instance.\n\nMost existing CDK apps are written as JavaScript apps or in a jsii language.\nWith the CDK Toolkit Library you can use these CDK apps by providing the `app` string as found in a `cdk.json` file:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\n\n// TypeScript\nawait cdk.fromCdkApp(\"ts-node app.ts\");\n\n// Python\nawait cdk.fromCdkApp(\"python app.py\");\n```\n\nThe `AssemblyBuilder` function provides basic Toolkit features like Lookups, but otherwise allows you to implement any custom source.\nFor example you build an inline CDK app on-the-fly:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\n\nconst cx = await cdk.fromAssemblyBuilder(async () => {\n  const app = new core.App();\n\n  // Define your stacks here\n  new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');\n\n  return app.synth();\n});\n```\n\n> Note that synthesis using the `AssemblyBuilder` is not safe to be performed\n> concurrently, since it mutates the globally shared `process.env`. You can set\n> `clobberEnv: false` to avoid this, but your builder function will need to do a\n> bit more work. See the documentation of `clobberEnv` for an example.\n\nExisting _Cloud Assembly_ directories can be used as source like this:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\n\nconst cx = await cdk.fromAssemblyDirectory(\"cdk.out\");\n```\n\n## Stack selection\n\nMost actions of the CDK Toolkit take a `StackSelector` to configure with stacks should be used for the action.\nA `StackSelector` and some optional additional values.\n\nTo select all stacks use the `ALL_STACKS` strategy:\n\n```ts\nconst allStacks = { strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.ALL_STACKS };\n```\n\nTo select only the top-level stacks from the main assembly, use the `MAIN_ASSEMBLY` strategy:\n\n```ts\nconst mainStacks = { strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.MAIN_ASSEMBLY };\n```\n\nThe `ONLY_SINGLE` strategy allows you to ensure a given assembly contains exactly one stack, and select it:\n\n```ts\nconst mainStacks = { strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.ONLY_SINGLE };\n```\n\nTo select stacks by IDs, use `PATTERN_MUST_MATCH` with an additional `patterns` property.\nIf no stacks are matched, this strategy will throw an error.\n\n```ts\nconst matchStacks = {\n  strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH,\n  patterns: [\"MyStack\"],\n};\n```\n\nYou can optionally declare that the provided patterns must match exactly one stack by using `PATTERN_MUST_MATCH_SINGLE`,\nor can match none at all by using `PATTERN_MATCH`.\n\n## Error handling\n\nThe CDK Toolkit uses structured errors to help you identify and handle issues during CDK Toolkit operations.\nThese errors provide detailed information about what went wrong and why.\n\nEach error includes one of the following sources, which represents where the error originates from:\n\n* toolkit - Error originates from the CDK Toolkit.\n* user - Error originates from the user, such as configuration or user input errors.\n\nEach error also includes a specific error type, such as authentication or validation, and a descriptive message. You can catch and handle these errors in your application to provide appropriate responses or fallback behaviors. If the CDK Toolkit throws other exceptions, they are bugs and you should report them by raising an issue.s\n\n### How to handle errors\n\nIn the CDK Toolkit Library, all errors are thrown as regular exceptions.\n\nUse helper methods provided by the CDK Toolkit to detect error types.\nEven though errors are typed, do not rely on instanceof checks because they can behave unexpectedly when working with multiple copies of the same package.\n\nThe following is a basic example:\n\n```ts\ndeclare const cdk: Toolkit;\ndeclare const cx: ICloudAssemblySource;\n\ntry {\n  // Attempt a CDK Toolkit operation\n  const deployment = await cdk.deploy(cx, {\n    stacks: ['MyStack']\n  });\n\n} catch (error) {\n  // Handle user error\n  if (ToolkitError.isToolkitError(error) && error.source === 'user') {\n    console.error('Hey, something is wrong with your app!', error.message);\n  } else {\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
